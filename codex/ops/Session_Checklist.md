# Session Checklist (Predator)

This checklist is designed to prevent confusion, overexposure, and emotional chasing.
Follow it exactly.

---

## 1) Pre-Session Setup (60 seconds)
- Confirm mode:
  - [ ] vRogue (Video / RNG)
  - [ ] LiveEdge (Live Table)
- Confirm table minimum: ____ units
- Set Buy-In Reference: **$100** (default)
- Confirm reserve rule: **profit-only scaling**
- Decide your session intent:
  - [ ] Data Collection (Cold Mode heavy)
  - [ ] Standard Hunt (balanced)
  - [ ] Recovery / Stabilize (conservative)

---

## 2) Start of Session (first 10 spins)
- [ ] Log every spin result
- [ ] Stay in **Cold Mode**
- [ ] Minimum bet only (keep-spinning)
- [ ] Do NOT add extra exposure “just because”

Goal: build memory, not force wins.

---

## 3) Cold Mode Rules (default state)
Cold Mode is active when no engagement criteria are met.

- [ ] Minimum bet only (1 unit total exposure)
- [ ] Track memory:
  - [ ] last 12–18 spins (short)
  - [ ] last 30+ spins (long confirmation building)
- [ ] Watch for repeat density, not “vibes”

---

## 4) Engagement Checklist (Before You Attack)
You may engage a cluster only if ALL are true:

- [ ] Short Memory trigger met:
  - 2 hits inside candidate set within last 12 spins
- [ ] Long confirmation met:
  - 3 hits inside candidate set within last 30 spins
- [ ] Cluster width is not too narrow:
  - minimum 5–8 numbers in the set
- [ ] Exposure cap is defined for this attack:
  - max total units at risk per spin = ____ units

If any box is unchecked → stay in Cold Mode.

---

## 5) During Engagement (Attack Mode)
- [ ] Start stagnation timer immediately
- [ ] Never increase exposure without rules-based reason
- [ ] Do NOT narrow the cluster further to “snipe harder”

### Stagnation Timer Rule
If no hit in the engaged set within **10 spins**:
1) reduce exposure
2) widen the set OR return to Cold Mode
3) never chase by narrowing further

---

## 6) Profit Lock (Mandatory)
When profit thresholds are hit:
- [ ] Lock profit immediately
- [ ] Locked profit cannot be re-risked this session

(Default thresholds can be adjusted later)

---

## 7) 50% Drawdown Recovery Protocol
If bankroll drops to 50% of buy-in reference:
- [ ] Enter Recovery Mode (Cold Mode only)
- [ ] Minimum exposure only
- [ ] Require stronger criteria before engagement
- [ ] Goal = stabilize, not “win it back fast”

---

## 8) End of Session Conditions
End session if ANY occur:
- [ ] Profit target reached and locked
- [ ] Execution integrity breaks (fatigue/confusion/misreads)
- [ ] War chest depleted (after rebuys per protocol)
- [ ] You feel the urge to chase (automatic stop trigger)

---

## 9) Post-Session Log (30 seconds)
Record:
- End bankroll: ______
- Rebuys used: ______
- Notes:
  - What triggered engagement?
  - Did stagnation timer fire?
  - Did you obey Recovery Mode rules?
