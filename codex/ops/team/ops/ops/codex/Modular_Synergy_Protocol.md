# Modular Synergy Protocol (MSP)

MSP is the doctrine that prevents Predator from being “one strategy forever.”
It forces real-time evaluation and module switching based on conditions.

The goal:
- stay alive,
- avoid overexposure,
- adapt without improvising.

## Core Principle
**Modules are tools.**
You do not “believe in” a module.
You deploy it only when conditions match.

---

## MSP Module List (Base Set)

### Module A: Cold Mode (Data Collection)
**Purpose:** keep spins flowing with minimal exposure.
**When used:** default state when no engagement criteria are met.

### Module B: Cluster Hunt (Standard Engagement)
**Purpose:** apply controlled pressure to repeat density.
**When used:** cluster criteria met and exposure cap allows.

### Module C: Recovery Mode (Stabilization)
**Purpose:** stop bleeding at 50% drawdown.
**When used:** bankroll hits drawdown line OR behavior triggers fire.

### Module D: Profit Protection (Lock + Downshift)
**Purpose:** prevent giving profit back.
**When used:** after profit thresholds hit OR session becomes unstable.

---

## Switching Logic (Simple)
MSP evaluates 3 categories every spin:

### 1) Data Condition
- Is there repeat density above baseline?
- Is the cluster wide enough to avoid overcommit?
- Is stagnation present?

### 2) Bankroll Condition
- Above buy-in reference?
- At profit lock thresholds?
- At 50% drawdown?

### 3) Human Condition
- fatigue present?
- frustration spike?
- confusion/miscommunication risk?

---

## MSP Decision Rules (Priority Order)
These rules override everything else.

### Priority 1: Integrity / Human Risk
If confusion, fatigue, or emotional chase signals appear:
- switch to **Recovery Mode** or **end session**

### Priority 2: Bankroll Protection
If profit lock thresholds hit:
- execute lock
- switch to **Profit Protection** module (downshift exposure)

If 50% drawdown line hit:
- switch to **Recovery Mode**

### Priority 3: Strategy Fit
If cluster criteria are met cleanly:
- switch to **Cluster Hunt**

If not:
- stay in **Cold Mode**

---

## Stagnation Handling (Module Forced Switch)
If Cluster Hunt is active and stagnation timer triggers:
- reduce exposure immediately
- widen set OR return to Cold Mode
- never narrow further

If stagnation repeats twice in the same session:
- force switch to **Profit Protection** or **Recovery Mode**

---

## MSP Command Format (Recommended)
Commands must include module name:

MODULE: Cold / Cluster / Recovery / ProfitProtect  
BET: ______  
UNITS: ______  
DURATION: ______  
NOTES: ______

Example:
MODULE: Cold  
BET: Even  
UNITS: 1  
DURATION: 1 spin  
NOTES: build memory

## MSP Win Condition
A “good session” is not defined only by profit.
A good session is:
- rules followed,
- exposure controlled,
- profit protected,
- losses contained,
- no chasing behavior.
