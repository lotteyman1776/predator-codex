# Stop-Loss & Recovery Protocol (Predator)

This protocol prevents the most destructive behavior in roulette:
**trying to win it back fast.**

Predator does not “revenge bet.”
Predator stabilizes, then re-engages only with evidence.

---

## Definitions
- **Buy-In Reference:** $100 (default)
- **50% Drawdown Line:** bankroll reaches $50 (or 50 units if unit-based)
- **Recovery Mode:** conservative state designed to stop bleeding

---

## Hard Rule
When bankroll hits **50% of Buy-In Reference**:

### You MUST:
- Enter **Recovery Mode**
- Reduce exposure to minimum
- Stop all cluster attacks unless criteria are stronger than normal

---

## Recovery Mode (Required Actions)
### 1) Return to Cold Mode
- Minimum bet only
- No layering
- No aggressive coverage

### 2) Slow the pace
- If you feel rushed, pause
- If live table pressure is high, step away

### 3) Rebuild memory
Recovery Mode goal is not profit.
It is **stability**.

---

## Stronger Re-Engagement Criteria (Recovery Override)
While in Recovery Mode, engagement requires:

- **3 hits inside candidate set within last 12 spins**
AND
- **4 hits inside candidate set within last 30 spins**
AND
- minimum cluster width maintained (5–8 numbers)
AND
- exposure cap reduced vs normal

If not met → remain in Recovery Mode.

---

## Recovery Exposure Cap (Recommended)
In Recovery Mode:
- total exposure per spin should be capped at **50% of normal**
- if unsure, cap at **1–2 units total**

---

## Exit Recovery Mode
You may exit Recovery Mode only when BOTH are true:
- bankroll has stabilized above the drawdown line for 10+ spins
- you have at least one clean, rules-based hit without escalation

---

## Automatic Session End Triggers
End the session immediately if:
- you break Recovery Mode rules
- you feel anger/frustration rising
- you catch yourself narrowing clusters to chase
- communication/execution becomes sloppy

Survival is the win condition.
